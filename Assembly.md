# Basic x86 Microcomputer Design:
## 1. CPU:
It is called Central Processing Unit and it is where the calculations and all the logical operations take place and it contains a limited number of storage locations called `registers`.
The other components interact with the CPU through the use of PINS
Most of these pings connect to the `data bus`, `control bus` and `address bus`
It also has the following parts:
- High Frequency Clock
- Contrl Unit (CU)
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

### Clock:
A clock synchronizes the internal operations of the CPU with other components within the system.
### Control Unit:
The control unit coordinates the sequences of steps involved in executing machine instructions.
### Arthimetic Logic Unit:
It performs all the arthimetic opertions such as addition, subtraction and/or multiplication. And it also handles the boolean experessions such as AND, OR and/or NOT.

## 2. Memory Storage Unit:
It is the main storage unit.
Receives requests for data from the CPU.
Is used to transfer data from RAM to CPU and vice versa.
Holds the data and instructions of the program(s) that is/are running.
Has the following types:
- ROM
- RAM

## 3. Buses:
![[Pasted image 20210406032931.png]]
A bus is a group of parallel wires that copy data from one of the computer to another. A bus is a pathway for digital signals to rapidly move data. There are 3 buses:
- Data Bus
- Control Bus
- Address Bus
### Data Bus:
### Control Bus:
### Address Bus:
The address bus carries addressing signals from the processor to memory, I/O (or peripherals), and other addressable devices around the processor. Control signals move out of the processor, but not in to it.

# x86 Operating Modes:
There are three primary operating modes:
- Protected Mode
- Real-Address Mode
- System Management Mode

## Protected Mode:
It has a sub-mode called `Virtual-8086 Mode`. This mode is the native state of the processor in which all instructions and features are available.  Programs are given seperate memory areas called `segments`. Which allows the processor to prevent programs from referencing outside of their segments. While in protected mode, the processor can directly executre real-address mode software such as `Obsidian`, `Word` etc in a safe multi-tasking environment. This means that, consider if a program was running such as `Sublime Text` and the program crashes, this mode would allow the program to be isolated and do not affected the other programs running.

## Real-Address Mode:
In this mode, the programming environment of Intel 8086 processor is implemented with a few extra features such as the ability to switch into other modes. This mode allows direct access to the system memory/hardware devices. and is used to run `Microsoft` or other vendors' programs. Programs running in this mode may allow the Operating System to crash.

## System Management Mode:
This is also known as `SMM`. It provides the Operating System with the mechanisms to implement to functions such as Power Management, System Security. These are often used by computer manufacturers who customize their processor for a particular system setup. 

# Registers:
 A register is a storage unit / container inside the processor core which can be accessed at much higher speeds than the conventional memory.
 ## 8086 Registers:
 Before moving on towards the more complex `extended` registers of x86 architecture, we must first know the basics, the `16 bit` registers or the `8086` registers. These registers are split into the following four categories.
 - General Purpose Registers
 - Index Registers
 - Status and Control Registers
 - Segment Regsiters

### General Purpose Registers
There are four general purpose registers:
#### AX:
AX is used as an [`accumulator`](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/accumulator.htm) and is preffered for most arthimetic and logical operations. It acts as a temporary storage location which holds an intermediate value in a mathematical and logical calculation. Each of the previous value in the accumulator is overwritten with new intermediate results of an operation.
Consider the following example, `3 + 4 + 5`, the accumulator would firstly hold the value `3`, then add 4 and  then it would hold `7` and then 5 would be added to 7 and the accumulator would hence hold `12`. The `AX` register consists of two sub-registers, each of `8 bits`. One is called `AH`, the other is `AL`, where H and L represent `High` and `Low` respectively.
In order to understand these, consider a 16-bit binary number,
<b><p style="text-align:center;">01011010-01001001</p></b>
This number is broken down into two seperate portions, each of 8 bit.
The upper portion - `01011010` is called `AH` -> Accumulator High, while, the lower portion `01001001` is called `AL` -> Accumulator Low.
-> NOTE: All The `General Purpose Registers` are divided into sub-registers, each of `8 bits` in a similar fashion.
Consider a following small assembly program to get a better grasp at the concept:
-> Ignore the `syntax` at this moment, everything will be explained later in a much better fashion.
```asm
; Example code for understanding the use of AX
.386
.model flat , stdcall;
.stack 4096
.code
main PROC
	; Adding three numbers: 3 + 4 + 5
	mov ax, 3
	add ax, 4
	add ax, 5
	; ax -> 12
	ret
main ENDP
END main
```
After running this program, we can have a look at the registers window in our Visual Studio, we can see that, AX -> 12. Just by looking at the `main` procedure, we can somewhat grasp as to what is going on.
#### BX:
BX is used as a `base` register and is typically used to hold the address of a procedure or a variable. In other words, it stores the value of the offset.
#### CX:
CX is called as `count` register and is typically used for looping.
#### DX:
# Integers:
## Structure:

# Directives:
- Assist and control assembly process
- Change the way code is assembled
- Also called pseudo-ops
- Not a part of the instruction set

## Directives used:
### .CODE:
- Indicate the start of a code segment
- The actual source code goes in this segment

### .DATA:
- Indicates the start of a data segment
- All the variables that are to be used can be declared in this segment

### .STACK:
- Indicated the start of a stack segment

### .END:
- Marks the end of a module.

### .DD:
- Allocates a double word (4 bytes)

### .DWORD:
- Same as .DD

# Instruction:
- A statement that becomes exectuable when a program is assembled is called an Instruction.
- They are translated by assembler into machine language bytes.

## Parts of an Instruction
```asm
	[label:] mnemonic [operands] [;comment]
where label and comments are optional

Example:
	start:	mov eax,1000h ;EAX = 10000h
	; Where:
	; start: 		 <- Label:
	; mov    		 <- mnemoic
	; eax    		 <- Register -> Operand 1
	; 1000h  		 <- Operand 2
	; ;EAX = 10000h  <- Commend
```
### Label:
- Used as a place marker for instructions and data
```asm
; Examples:
; Data Label
count DWORD 100 ; <- Declares a variable named count of 32 bytes and assigns a value of 100

; Code Labels
; Example:
;; Loop:
start:
	mov ax, bx
	jmp start ; goes back to start
; These can also be oneliners:
start: mov ax,bax ; <- This is completely valid
```

### Mnemonic:
- Identifies an instruction:
#### Some mnemonics:
- mov : Assigns one value to another.
```asm
	mov 10, eax; Assigns 10 to eax.
```
- add: Adds two values together.
```asm
	add 10, 15; adds 10 to 15.
```
- sub: Subtracts one value from another
```asm
	mov 15, eax
	sub eax, 20
```
- mul: Multiplies two values
```asm
	mul 20, 5; 100
```
- jmp: Jump to a new location -> Is used to jump to a data label
```asm
	start:
		mov	eax, 25;
		jmp start; -> Acts as an infinte loop
```
- Call: Calls a procedure. Just like a function call in c++
```asm
	call DUMPREGS; an irvine library procedure.
```

### Operand:
- Also known as Arthimetic
- Quantity on which an operation can be done.
- Operands can be constants e.g. 20
- They can also be constant expression e.g. 35-7
- They can also be a register name such as `EAX`
- They can also be a location in memory e.g. `count` where `count` is variable name

### Block Comments:
- Block Comments:
- `COMMENT` Keyword is used to declare a multiline comment.
```asm
COMMENT !
	THIS IS
		A MULTI LINE
			COMMENT
!
COMMENT &
	AMPERSAND can also be used to
		represent multiline
	comments
&
```

### Simple Assembly Program:
```asm
.386
.model flat , stdcall;
.stack 4096
.code
main PROC
	mov eax, 10000h
	add eax, 40000h
	sub eax, 20000h
	ret
main ENDP
END main
```

#### Breakdown:
##### .386:
This directive identifies the minimum CPU required to run the program
##### .model:
This is used for two purposes
- Identifying the segmentation model (memory model)
- Identifies the convention used to Pass parameters to procedures
-> FLAT:
This tells the assembler to use the Flat memory model meaning that it tells the assembler to generate  code for Protected-mode programs.
-> STDCALL:
Enables the calling of built-in Windows API.
##### .STACK:
Used to allocate a stack of N bytes.
##### .CODE:
Marks the beginning of the code segment where all the executable statement are located.
##### PROC:
Identifies the beginning of a procedure. The name of the procedure is followed by the PROC keyword. In our program:
`main PROC`. Where `main` is the name of the procedure.
##### ENDP:
Marks the end of a procedure. Similar to PROC, ENDP is preceded by the name of the procedure.
##### END:
END is the last instruction that is to be executed. It is followed by the name of the starter procedure.

### Declaring Variables in x86 Assembly:
```asm
.386
.MODEL flat
.STACK 4096

.DATA
num1	dword	11111111h
num2	dword	10101010h
ans		dword	0

.code
main PROC
	mov eax, num1
	add eax, num2
	mov ans, eax
	ret
main ENDP
END main
```

	!
	;; The first number will be stored at the lowest memory address
	;; The last number at the highest.
```
- Strings

```asm
hello BYTE "Hello, World", 0 ; This is a null terminated string
;; Strings can also be multilined
hello BYTE "Welcome Back"
	  BYTE "Are you ready?"
	  BYTE "Let's GOooooo", 0 ; The last portion is null-terminated.
```

### WORD:
A WORD occupies 16 bits in memory and can represent 0-65535 if unsigned or -32768 to +32767 if it is signed. 
```asm
;; Initialized Variable
	word_1 WORD 65535d    ; largest unsigned value
	word_2 WORD -32768d   ; smallest signed value
;; Uninitialized Variable
	uninit WORD ?         ; uninitialized variable, unsigned
;; Multiple Initializers
	list WORD 1,2,3,4,5 ; Array
	;; They will be stored in consecutive memory blocks
	COMMENT !
		OFFSET   |   VALUE
		0000     |    1
		0002     |    2
		0004     |    3
		0006     |    4
		0008     |    5

	;; The last number at the highest.
	;; Each offset has a difference of 2 as a WORD consists of 2 BYTES
```

### DWORD:
A DWORD occupies 32 bits or 8 Bytes in memory and can represent 0-4,294,967,296 if unsigned or -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647 if it is signed. 
```asm

	;; The last number at the highest.
	;; Each offset has a difference of 4 as a WORD consists of 4 BYTES
```

# ENDIANESS:
Defines how data is stored and received from memory.
x86 uses Little Endian Order. This means that LSB is stored at the first memory address allocated. The rest are stored in consecutive memory block and go from LSB to MSB. Consider the following number : `12345678h`
In little endian, the table would be as follows:
```sql
12345678h

Little Endian:
\x78\x56\x34\x12
Where:
78 is Least Significant Bit -> LSB
12 is Most Significant Bit -> MSB

 OFFSET       |    VALUES
  0000        |     78
  0001        |     56
  0002        |     34
  0003        |     12

If we were to look at Big Endian, the table would be as follows:

 OFFSET       |    VALUES
  0000        |     12
  0001        |     34
  0002        |     56
  0003        |     78
		  
```
