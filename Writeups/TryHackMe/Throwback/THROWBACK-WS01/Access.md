In order to gain access to this machine, 
we need to visit the mail and then send everyone a phishing mail:

```
Hey Everyone,

This is an update to the software that was provided to each of you last month. Unfortunately, that version had a few bugs and lead to data being deleted. Here's the updated version. Update it as soon as you can so that no one is left behind and hopefully no one will face any bugs.

Regards,
IT Support
```

This should be sent to everyone :

```
HumphreyW@throwback.local
SummersW@throwback.local
FoxxR@throwback.local
DaibaN@throwback.local
PeanutbutterM@throwback.local
PetersJ@throwback.local
DaviesJ@throwback.local
BlaireJ@throwback.local
GongoH@throwback.local
MurphyF@throwback.local
JeffersD@throwback.local
HorsemanB@throwback.local
```

Now the file that should be uploaded  should be a reverse staged shell:

```bash

```
