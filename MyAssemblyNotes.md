## Virtual Machine Concept in Computer Science :
Computer Hardware and Software are related to each other through a concept called `Virtual Machine`.
To Understand this concept consider a program written in High level language such as c++ or java.Now we already know that Computer executes instructions in machine code, so  to convert this high level code into machine code we can use interpretation (line by line conversion to machine code) or Compilation of the entire program to machine code.
In terms of virtual machine we can say that first the program gets is converted from high level code to assembly code by Virtual Machine 1 and then that Assembly is converted to Machine code by Virtual Machine 2.

## Levels of instructions
### level 1:
level 1 can be the Digital Logic Hardware.
### level 2:
`Instruction Set Architecture` comes in level 2 where machine language is executed by a program embedded in computer microprocessor called microprogram.
### level 3:
This is where the 'Assembly Langauge' operates which uses mnemonics such as ADD,SUB,MOV which are translated to machine language.
### level 4:
This is where most of us work today i.e. High Level Langauges operate here which get translated by their repective compilers.
